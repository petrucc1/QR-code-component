# QR-code-component

The sole purpose of this project was to create a simple design with a QR code to train responsiveness in CSS3. It is possible to visualize how the project turned out in folder "design", where there is the original prototype of the challenge carried out by Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).
